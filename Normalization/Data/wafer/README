This subdirectory contains the wafer database as discussed in

  Robert T. Olszewski.  "Generalized Feature Extraction for Structural
  Pattern Recognition in Time-Series Data."  PhD thesis, Carnegie
  Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 2001.

The wafer database comprises a collection of time-series data sets
where each file contains the sequence of measurements recorded by one
vacuum-chamber sensor during the etch process applied to one silicon
wafer during the manufacture of semiconductor microelectronics.  Each
wafer has an assigned classification of normal or abnormal.  The
abnormal wafers are representative of a range of problems commonly
encountered during semiconductor manufacturing.

The data files contained in the wafer database were collected while
monitoring an operational semiconductor fabrication plant.

The directory structure is as follows:

  wafer/README   - this file
  wafer/abnormal - data files for abnormal wafers
  wafer/normal   - data files for normal wafers

The name of each data file has the following format:

  <run>_<wafer>.<desc>

where

    <run> - the run (or batch) number
  <wafer> - wafer number within the run
   <desc> - file descriptor; set as follows:
  

6 - data from radio frequency forward power sensor
                
7 - data from radio frequency reflected power sensor
                
8 - data from chamber pressure sensor
               
11 - data from 405 nm emission sensor
               
12 - data from 520 nm emission sensor
               
15 - data from direct current bias sensor
